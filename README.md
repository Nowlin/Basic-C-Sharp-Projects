# Basic C-Sharp Projects
These are some small projects I made using C# and .NET Framework
 
**Projects:**

[Twenty One](https://github.com/Nowlin/Basic-C-Sharp-Projects/tree/main/Twenty%20One)

This project is a C# application that mimics the card game, Twenty One. It allows a person to play "Black Jack" against a computer opponent.

[Car Insurance](https://github.com/Nowlin/Basic-C-Sharp-Projects/tree/main/CarInsurance)

This project is an MVC web application that mimics a car insurance website. It takes user's input on policy information and calculates a quote based on business logic. There is also an admin page that allows staff to view all of the quotes that have been issued.
